Questions:

    1. ( ) Why do we put a minus sign in front of the error code? (getattr() in a1fs.c)
        - Why is the convention to returna  negated error code?

    2. (Fixed) For a1fs_getattr(), what if the path name is root?
        - Use a do while loop to deal with the root inode first.

    3. ( ) How should we fill in st->st_mode in a1fs_getattr?

    4. ( ) Should we really set a1fs_extent.count's type to a1fs_blk_t? Is this set by prof?

Notes:

    - Only implement these for struct stat
        struct stat {
            mode_t    st_mode;    /* protection */
            nlink_t   st_nlink;   /* number of hard links */
            off_t     st_size;    /* total size, in bytes */
            blkcnt_t  st_blocks;  /* number of 512B blocks allocated */
            time_t    st_mtime;   /* time of last modification */
        };

    - 256 bytes per dentry, then an directory could contain 8192 dentries at max.

    - How to visit a file/dir from absolute path:
        1. Go to superblock for root inode
        1.5 In root inode, take the dentry_count, go to the corresponding extent
        2. In curr( inode, take the dentry_count, go to the corresponding extent
        3. do a for-loop to search for the dir_name in path
        4. Go to the corresponding inode
        5. repeat 2~4 until all the end of absolute path (NULL)

    -   struct timespec {
           time_t tv_sec;                /* Seconds */
           long   tv_nsec;               /* Nanoseconds */
        };

Todos:
    - Extend step 2 in a1fs_getattr
    - Fill in st->st_mode in a1fs_getattr
